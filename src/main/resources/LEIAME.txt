In any modern browser, the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a relevant specification with the emergence of HTML5 and JS clients that consume data via REST APIs.

In many cases, the host that serves the JS (e.g. example.com) is different from the host that serves the data (e.g. api.example.com). In such a case, CORS enables the cross-domain communication.

Spring provides first class support for CORS, offering an easy and powerful way of configuring it in any Spring or Spring Boot web application.
